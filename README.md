## Project Approach and Technology:
- For this project we will use Blazer for the front end which will allow the team to work with C# for both front end and back end.
- Use entity framwork to tie eveything together.
- Working through GitHub, we will push and pull our work from our local decive to the git repository (team members will use any IDE they feel comfortable with).
- Each team members has a specific role assigned to them. This ensures that we complete every task of the project.
