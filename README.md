Description:
In this porject, we will developp a career platform web application. On this platform, we will have employers, sutdents (the candidates), and an admin role. Employers will be able to creat a profile, login, browse candidates, create job postings as well as select candidates for interviews. The students, similar to employers will be able to create and login to a profile, browse for job offers, and upload their resume. For the role of the admin, they will have complete controle over the platform. In other words, they manage all user profiles and postings on the web site.
