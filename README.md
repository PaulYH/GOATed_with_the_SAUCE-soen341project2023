**SOEN 341 Project - Winter 2023 ðŸ”¥**


## Description:

In this project, we will develop a career platform web application. On this platform, we will have employers, students (the candidates), and an admin role. Employers will be able to create a profile, login, browse candidates, create job postings as well as select candidates for interviews. The students, similar to employers will be able to create and login to a profile, browse for job offers, and upload their resume. For the role of the admin, they will have complete control over the platform. In other words, they manage all user profiles and postings on the web site.

## Project Approach and Technology:

- **C#**: primary language (front-end and back-end)
- **Blazor**: allows the writing of C# on the front-end
- **Blazorise**: library for UI components
- **Entity Framework Core**: allows for easy connection between web app and database
- **SQL Server**: relational database
- **ASP.NET**: the above technologies are built on this framework

- Working through GitHub, we will push and pull our work from our local device to the git repository (team members will use any IDE they feel comfortable with).
- Each team member has a specific role assigned to them. This ensures that we complete every task of the project.
