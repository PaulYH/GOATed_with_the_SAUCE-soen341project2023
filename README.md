**SOEN 341 Project - Winter 2023 ðŸ”¥**


## Description:

In this project, we will develop a career platform web application. This platform will have three types of users: employers, students (the candidates), and admins. Employers will be able to create a profile, login, browse candidates, create job postings as well as select candidates for interviews. The students, similar to employers, will be able to create and login to a profile, browse for job offers, and upload their resume. For the role of the admin, it will have complete control over the platform. In other words, the admins manage all user profiles and postings on the web site.

## Project Approach and Technology:

- For this project we will use Blazor for the front end which will allow the team to work with C# for both front and back end.
- Use Entity Framwork to tie everything together.
- Working through GitHub, we will push and pull our work from and to our local devices to the git repository (team members will use any IDE they feel comfortable with).
- Each team member has a specific role assigned to them. This ensures that we complete every task of the project.
